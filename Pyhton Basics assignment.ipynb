    "#Q. 1) Explain the key features of Python that make it a popular choice for programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Python is one of the most popular programming language due to its versatile key features that make it easy to use,and powerful for both beginners and experienced.\n",
    "Some of its key features are:\n",
    "(a.)  Simple and readable Syntax:  Pythonâ€™s syntax is designed to be easy to understand and use,resembling natural language.This simplicity lowers the learning curve,making it accessible for beginners.\n",
    "(b.)  Interpreted Language:        Python is an interpreted language,meaning that code is executed line by line.This allows for quicker testing and debugging since there is no need for a compilation step.\n",
    "(c.)  Cross-Platform compatibility:  Python is platform independent,that means it can run on various operating systems like Windows,macOS,Linux etc.\n",
    "(d.)  Object-Oriented and functional programming:  Python supports both object-oriented programming (OOP) and functional programming.  We can create classes and objects to model real-world entities or we can use functions for a more functional approach.\n",
    "(e.)  Easy integration with other languages: Python can easily integrate with other languages like C,C++, and Java."
